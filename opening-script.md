# 60-Second Opening Script: Introducing AI into University Curriculum

## Script

**[Pause for attention - 2 seconds]**

Good morning. I want to start with a question: How many of you used AI in your professional work this week? ChatGPT? Copilot? Data analysis tools?

**[Pause]**

Here's what we discovered: **82% of our adjunct faculty are already using AI tools in their professional roles**—analyzing data, drafting proposals, generating insights. But here's the gap: **only 53% are bringing those same tools into the classroom.**

We're at an inflection point. Industry is moving faster than academia, and our students are entering a job market where AI proficiency isn't optional—it's essential. 

Today, we're launching our **AI Curriculum Integration Initiative** for the Graduate Business & Leadership Program. This isn't about replacing teaching—it's about **bridging the gap** between what you're already doing professionally and what we can do together in the classroom.

We've surveyed 47 faculty members, and the message is clear: **68% want more training**, **53% want deeper integration**, but they need support—examples, templates, and clear guidelines.

So today, we're here to start that conversation. How do we take your professional expertise and translate it into curriculum that prepares our students for the jobs they'll actually have?

Let's begin.
